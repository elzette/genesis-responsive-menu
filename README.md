=======================

Change genesis child theme menu to toggle and push down on smaller screens.

Originally by <a href="https://github.com/tessalt/dropdowns">https://github.com/tessalt/dropdowns</a> - adapted to fit Genesis menu classes.
To use when building a custom child theme, using the Genesis framework.

Include the jQuery and CSS styles in the child theme for the main navigation menu. 
This will create a responsive menu that will change upon reaching a screen width as specified in the jQuery.

The main menu will become hidden, adding a 'MENU' button, top right instead. 
The 'MENU' button will toggle the navigation and push the content down when open.
This also style a sub navigation.
